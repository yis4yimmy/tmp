I'm a designer turned developer with a passion for connected products. I recently started working at [Shaper Tools](https://shapertools.com) as a front-end engineer.

I don't have a CS degree, although I did go to a [very CS-ey school](https://id.gatech.edu/academics/mid) if that sort of thing matters to you. I am mostly self-taught via tutorials, e-books, and on-the-job experience.

My interest in testing was born out of my [industrial design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_design) education. We were constantly challenged to test our assumptions with real potential users. We learned techniques to ensure we got honest answers as well. Testing became the defacto way for me to understand if what I built was good.

Five years ago when I started my move into software development, I was sort of surprised to find that a lot of people I was working with didn't test their code. Or if they did, their tests didn't really tell you much about what their code did. Or more importantly what it was supposed to do.

There are plenty of sources out there for testing best practices. I don't really need to repeat what is going on there; nor do I want to cut in one someone's ü•ì. I want to [talk about the interesting edges](/) that I hit that test my patience more than anything else.
