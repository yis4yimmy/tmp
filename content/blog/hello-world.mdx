Why start a blog?

Because I hate the sound of my own voice so a podcast was a non-starter.

I often find myself in situations when it comes to testing code where I have to go well beyond what I can find in documentation or forum posts to be able to test the things I want to. I want a place to jot these things down so I can share them with the broader community and see if others encounter the same issues.

I'd like to share ideas about what is currently working for me, and what drives me up the wall.

## Format

Right now I'm thinking each topic/post will center around testing one type of user flow. For some of the more complex ones there will likely be multiple posts.

Sometimes I might create a GitHub repo to accompany a larger topic.

## Topics

Recently I've been doing a lot of e-commerce at [work](https://www.shapertools.com) and find myself needing to test interactions with third-party e-commerce platforms (think Shopify/Recharge).

I haven't done much end-to-end testing, but am intrigued by exploring writing tests that mutate data and require re-setting it correctly after the test run; regardless if the test run passes or fails. For example, a test user creates an account on our site; but we want to use the same email/password combo each time so we need to be able to delete that user after the test has run.

I also want to just share my thoughts about why I choose the testing tools I use and some of the things I do to make writing and debugging my tests easier.
